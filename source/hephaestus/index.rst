Hephaestus
==========

.. image:: hephaistos.jpg

Hephaestus is the god of fire, metalworking, smiths and the art of sculpture. 
Hephaestus was the craftsmen for many of the immortals’’ weapons, dwellings and 
furnishings as well as some mortals’ equipment. His workshop has been placed 
under a volcano causing it to erupt on many occasions. 
:doc:`Zeus </zeus/index>` had Hephaestus and 
:doc:`Aphrodite </aphrodite/index>` married to hopefully avoid any wars over 
her. Aphrodite was unfaithful to her husband and cheated on him many times, one 
of which was :doc:`Ares </ares/index>`. At one point Hephaestus made a trap 
that left Aphrodite and Ares in a golden net so the other gods could laugh at 
them. Athena and Hephaestus are often associated with bringing the arts to man, 
though :doc:`Athena </athena/index>` is often more popular. 


Birth of Hephaestus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hephaestus was born from Zeus and Hera, though some think that he was born from 
just Hera in response of Athena. Myths seem to place Hephaestus as older so 
that would not be the case. When he was born Hephaestus was weak and crippled. 
Because of his ugliness, his parents through him down from Olympus.
