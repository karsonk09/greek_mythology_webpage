Zeus is the Greek god of the sky and the overall ruler of all of the ancient 
Greek gods. Zeus is usually depicted as a large man with long hair and a long 
beard. He holds a lightning bolt in one hand which he throws at others that 
displease him. He also wears a toga (Greek clothing) of unspecified color. Zeus 
was named the ruler of the gods because he overthrew his father, Cronus, who 
was the original ruler of Olympus (the home of the gods). Zeus won a sort of 
"drawing" between his two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, and himself to become 
the ruler of the gods and the lord of the sky and the rain. 

Birth of Zeus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zeus is the youngest son of the titan Cronus and his wife Rhea. In most myths 
Zeus was hidden in a cave by his mother Rhea in order to avoid being devoured 
by Cronus. After Zeus had grown up he returned to his father Cronus and made 
him regurgitate Zeus' previously devoured siblings. After doing so, Zeus and 
his siblings fought Cronus *and* the other titans for control over the universe.
