Apollo is the Greek god of music, the Sun, medicine (and plague), knowledge, archery, and light. He has an older twin sister named Artemis, the goddess of wilderness and the hunt. Apollo is described as having a slimming, but very fit physique and a youthful face, so in most of his depictions he never had a beard. He is also described as playing music throughout Olympus, as he always had his lyre with him. As he was one of the more intelligent Olympians, he was also known for teaching man the art of medicine, as well as punishing them with ill-health and plague.
