Athena is the goddess of wisdom, war, crafts and weaving. Athena and 
:doc:`Hephaestus </hephaestus/index>` are both contributed with being the great 
patrons of both useful and elegant arts. She has been deemed the goddess of 
wisdom because of her contributions to man and the knowledge that she gave. 
Athena has often been shown sitting at the right hand of 
:doc:`Zeus </zeus/index>` providing him her counsel. Athena and 
:doc:`Hermes </hermes/index>` helped Perseus kill Medusa by providing him with 
Athenaâ€™s polished shield and Athena guided his sword hand. The people of 
Athens, before it was named, had a contest to see which of the gods the city 
would be named after. Athena made the first olive tree for the people while 
:doc:`Poseidon </poseidon/index>` made the first horse resulting in Athena 
winning the competition. Athena is also known for being the goddess of weaving 
and once a human named Arachne challenged her to a contest of weaving. Arachne 
wove a beautiful image that consisted of the death of Athena of which Athena 
took great offense to and turned Arachne into the first spider. Athena is one 
of the three Olympian virgin goddesses including :doc:`Hestia </hestia/index>` 
and :doc:`Artemis </artemis/index>`.



Birth of Athena
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Athena was born from the forehead of Zeus, completely armored and fully grown 
after Zeus had a massive headache. Some times it is stated that Hephaestus 
split Zeus's head and then Athena was born.
