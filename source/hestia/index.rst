Hestia is the goddess of the hearth and home. She is also the goddess of 
sacrificial flame, then getting a part of every sacrifice to the gods. Hestia 
has often been portrayed as a modestly vailed woman that is sometimes holding a 
branch or with a kettle. The hearth was looked upon as the symbol for the center
 of domestic life, so Hestia was the giver of domestic happiness and blessings. 
 She often appears next to Hermes as a deus penetralis, for protecting the works
  of man. Hestia like Athena and Artemis are eternal virgins. After Posiden and
  Apollo were after her hand she swore on Zeusâ€™s head that she would remain a 
  virgin for all time. Honoring Hestia for her oath, Zeus made Hestia in charge 
  of his royal hearth.
