Hestia is the goddess of the hearth and home. She is also the goddess of 
sacrificial flame, then getting a part of every sacrifice to the gods. Very few 
special temples are specifically for Hestia but every pyrtaneum was a sanctuary 
for her. Hestia has often been portrayed as a modestly vailed woman that is 
sometimes holding a branch or with a kettle. The hearth was looked upon as the 
symbol for the center of domestic life, so Hestia was the giver of domestic 
happiness and blessings. She often appears next to 
:doc:`Hermes </hermes/index>` as a *deus penetralis*, for protecting the works 
of man. Hestia like :doc:`Athena </artemis/index>` and 
:doc:`Artemis </artemis/index>` are eternal virgins. After 
:doc:`Poseidon </poseidon/index>` and :doc:`Apollo </apollo/index>` were after 
her hand she swore on Zeusâ€™s head that she would remain a virgin for all time. 
Honoring Hestia for her oath, :doc:`Zeus </zeus/index>` made Hestia in 
charge of his royal hearth.
