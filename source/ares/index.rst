Ares is the Greek god of war, violence, and bloodshed. He was often depicted to 
sport a spear and helmet with his armor. Ares was associated with the more 
unpleasant side of war, as oppose to his counterpart Athena, who repesented 
military strategy and intelligence. He was associated with all of these 
attributes to war and towards the neccessary aggression of battle, many of the 
Olympians found him to be hostile and were rather not pleased by his presence. 
Even in the mortal world man did not worship Ares as they did the other Greek 
gods.
